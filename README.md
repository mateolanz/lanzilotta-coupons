# Architecture Decision Record

# Coupons App

## Status

Accepted.

## Context

We need a system to mange discount coupons for a store..

## Decision

I used Django to take advantage of its default admin site, it is easy to use and very intuitive

## Consequences

Now is easier to see, create, delete, edit and activate or activate or desactivate every coupon we want. The store is happy now :)
